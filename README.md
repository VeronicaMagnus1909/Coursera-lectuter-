# Coursera - My respectable lecturer

I and My lecturer in Coursera - Prof. Andrew Ng. I was impressive by him because of the clear way he transmitted the knowledge, quality of all courses and often gave me some advices on career path. This pic is the opportunity I saw him in FPT annual event. By the way, his company, Landing AI signed the contract with FPT - a tech company of Vietnam. Also on this event, he had presentation and talkshow with other guests. I remembered clearly that he wrote line some codes dirrectly on the stage. It was so funny=))

Beside learning the suject of my major - Electical Enginnering, I would like to learn more expecrience things online
### I. Machine learning: 3 courses in Machine learning specialization

#### Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
This course instructed me on machine learning road. I had learned some concepts, definitions and wrotten some lines of codes by awkward way=))

#### Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
I might have been more familiar with machine learning but actually, the difficulty was that I did not have time beacuse of other subject assignments. So, I took the opportunity to work on it. Luckily, I've finished it with enjoyment

#### Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
I took this course in the first main semeter 20231. I had some interesting experience with concepts of reinforcement learning, why the systems khow what spams email on my account, coding K-mean algorithm,...
